# Awesome-Adversarial-Sample-on-Graph
A list of awesome papers and cool resources on the topoc about adversarial sample on graph data. This list is focused on date data poisoning and defencing on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Please don't hesitate to suggest resources in other subfields of this topic.
